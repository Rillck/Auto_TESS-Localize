# üöÄ Auto TESS-Localize

**Auto TESS-Localize** is an automated extension of the [`TESS-Localize`](https://github.com/Higgins21/TESS-Localized) package (Higgins et al. 2022).  
It enables batch analysis of multiple TESS targets (TICs), given known sectors and periods, producing high-resolution outputs and formatted results.

---

## üß≠ Purpose

To streamline and accelerate the application of `TESS-Localize` across multiple targets, converting orbital periods into frequencies and automating the identification of the origin of periodic signals in TESS light curves.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **User input via file selection** (`.txt` format with headers: `TIC, Sector, Period`);
- **Automatic period-to-frequency conversion** (`1 / period`);
- **Integration with TESS-Localize** for target localization;
- **Gaia DR3 source comparison** using `astroquery.vizier` and `mast`;
- **SNR maps with target highlighted in red**;
- **Light curve plots** with fitted model;
- **Numerical outputs** saved with 6 decimal precision;
- **Progress tracking** for batch execution.

- **Optional local mode (`Auto_TESS-Localize_local.py`)**: skips online Gaia ID lookup and instead requires a `DR3Name` column in the input file.


---

## üìÅ Outputs

- **Folder:** `TESS-Localize images/`
  - `TIC<id>_<sector>_SNR.png`: SNR map with Gaia stars and fitted source;
  - `TIC<id>_<sector>_LCfit.png`: Light curve with best-fit model.

- **CSV Output:** `result Auto TESS_Localize.csv`
  ```csv
  TIC, Sector, Period (days), Frequency (1/day),
  Source Gaia DR3 (TIC), Best Gaia Source (Localize),
  p-value, Relative Likelihood, Match?
  ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative Version: Auto_TESSLocalize_local.py

This version of the script is designed for users who **already have the Gaia DR3 source IDs** for their TIC targets and want to avoid performing online queries.

### ‚úÖ Key Differences:
- Skips the Gaia ID query via `astroquery`.
- Requires an additional column named `DR3Name` in the input `.txt` file:
  
  ```csv
  TIC, Sector, Period, DR3Name```
  
- The script uses the DR3Name directly for comparison and analysis.
- This is especially useful when working to reduce query time for large datasets.
