# üöÄ Auto TESS-Localize

**Auto TESS-Localize** is an automated tool built on top of the [`TESS-Localize`](https://github.com/Higgins21/TESS-Localized) package (Higgins et al. 2022). It allows systematic analysis of a list of TESS targets with known sector and orbital period.

---

## üß≠ Purpose

To streamline and speed up the use of `TESS-Localize` on multiple TESS targets (TICs), providing a clean Python interface that converts periods into frequencies and automates the process of locating the origin of periodic signals observed in TESS light curves.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Input: list of targets with `TIC`, `Sector`, and `Period (in days)`;
- Automatic conversion of period to frequency (`1 / period`);
- Batch execution of the localization analysis using `tl.Localize`;
- Retrieval of the **best-matching Gaia DR3 source** using `astroquery.vizier`;
- Comparison with the **Gaia DR3 source ID associated with the TIC** (via MAST);
- Automatic generation of visual outputs:
  - SNR maps with the input TIC highlighted in **red**;
  - Light curve plots with fitted model;
- Results compiled in a structured output.

---

## üìÅ Outputs

- **`TESS-Localize images/`**:  
  Contains two figures per TIC:
  - `TIC<id>_setor<sector>_SNR.png`: SNR map with Gaia sources and best-fit location;
  - `TIC<id>_setor<sector>_LCfit.png`: light curve with fitted model.

- **Optional CSV file**:
  ```csv
  TIC, Sector, Period (days), Frequency, Gaia DR3 Source (TIC), Best Source (Localize), Match?
  ```
